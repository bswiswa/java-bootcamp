/* performance issues with autoboxing and auto-unboxing
   Run the boxed primitive loop first then comment it out and run
   the one using pure primitives to compare perfomance

   EXPLANATION:
   In sum + i, one operand is an object and the other is a primitive. 
In this case auto-unboxing occurs on sum from Long to long. Then long sum is added to long i. 
After the addition, the total is assigned back into sum, which is a Long boxed primitive and 
so the total is autoboxed again and assigned to sum. So roughly 2^31 Long object instances
 are being created which is a very expensive procedure.
